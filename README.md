## Ntdll PatchChecker

### üìå Description

`Ntdll PatchChecker` is a Windows based tool written in Python that performs **in memory integrity checks** against critical `ntdll.dll` APIs (e.g., `NtReadFile`, `NtOpenProcess`, etc.) in the **SysMain service process**. It's designed to help identify hooks and patches by comparing memory pages of system functions.

This tool does not rely on WinDbg or external modules just pure `ctypes`, `pywin32`, and `psutil`.

### üî¨ How It Works
1. Locates the SysMain (SuperFetch) service process using Windows Service Control Manager
2. Opens the target process with appropriate memory read permissions using multiple fallback methods
3. Locates `ntdll.dll` in the target process using:
   - Standard `EnumProcessModules` API
   - Extended enumeration with different filtering flags
   - Manual memory scanning as a last resort when APIs fail
4. For each monitored API function:
   - Reads the first 16 bytes from the local (clean) ntdll.dll copy
   - Reads the corresponding bytes from the remote process memory
   - Performs byte-by-byte comparison of the first 16 bytes (function entry point)
5. Reports any differences found, showing potential hooks or modifications


## üéÆ Monitored Functions
```
File System APIs:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtCreateFile       - Creates/opens files and directories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtOpenFile         - Opens existing files  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtReadFile         - Reads data from files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtWriteFile        - Writes data to files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtQueryInformationFile - Queries file metadata
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NtSetInformationFile   - Modifies file metadata

Process Management APIs:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtCreateProcess    - Creates new processes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtCreateProcessEx  - Extended process creation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NtOpenProcess      - Opens existing processes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NtTerminateProcess - Terminates processes
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

  pip install psutil pywin32
  ```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/windows-patch-detector.git
cd windows-patch-detector

pip install psutil pywin32
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Must be run as Administrator
python patch_detector.py
```
### Understanding the Output
The tool provides detailed logging and results:
```

----------------------------------------
[LOG] Looking for SysMain PID
[LOG] Got SysMain at PID 1234
Found SysMain at PID 1234
[LOG] listing modules for PID 1234

```

## üîç Technical Implementation Details

### Process Access Methods
The tool uses a multi layered approach to gain process access:

1. **Primary**: `PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ` (0x0410)
2. **Fallback 1**: `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ` (0x1010)  
3. **Fallback 2**: `PROCESS_VM_READ` only (0x0010)
4. **Last Resort**: `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` (0x1000)

### Module Discovery Methods

**Method 1: Standard Enumeration**
- Uses `EnumProcessModules` API
- Most reliable on older Windows versions

**Method 2: Extended Enumeration**  
- Uses `EnumProcessModulesEx` with different filter flags:
  - `LIST_MODULES_ALL` (0x03)
  - `LIST_MODULES_DEFAULT` (0x01)  
  - `LIST_MODULES_32BIT` (0x02)

**Method 3: Manual Memory Scanning**
- Scans process memory regions using `VirtualQueryEx`
- Looks for PE headers (MZ signature)
- Searches for ntdll.dll strings in memory
- Used when API-based methods fail

### Patch Detection Algorithm

The tool compares the first 16 bytes of each functions entry point:
- Reads 64 bytes total but focuses on first 16 for comparison
- Counts byte by byte differences
- Reports any modifications found
- Shows both clean and "dirty" (modified) hex dumps

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Additional API functions to monitor
- Support for other target processes besides SysMain
- Enhanced bypass techniques for protected processes
- Better signature analysis and pattern matching
